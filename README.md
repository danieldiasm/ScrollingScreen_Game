# ScrollingScreen Game
A screen scrolling game. I've been learning Lua, then I've decided to make a game. 

It is made using LOVE2d Framework

Still unfinished.

## Installation
Well, to "install" Love2D games you just have to put the entire game directory inside a directory and zip it. 
After so you rename de extension from ".zip" to ".love", then you'll be able to run it.


## About
It is no longer maintained, I doubt that I'll finish it sometime soon.
